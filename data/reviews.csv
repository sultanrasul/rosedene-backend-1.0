Lovely grounds, about a 15 minute flat walk to the city centre along the river ness which is beautiful. We really did enjoy our stay.

There was also no bottle opener and some of the dishes were dirty that had been put away in the cupboards. The shower door bangs shut and might break eventually, it needs a soft close solution.

We do recall on your final night stay you brought to our attention that you thought you had booked an apartment with a bath. We checked this and you had definitely not booked an apartment with a bath and your booking notes didn’t have any request for a bath either.
 
We would like to take this opportunity to mention that we are on the path towards accreditation for our sustainable tourism efforts, as a part of these efforts there was a reduction in the number of baths incorporated into the building design. Had we known that you would have liked an apartment with a bath we would have happily allocated one to you at the time of your booking.

It is most unfortunate that you have chosen to do this. We will now report your misconduct to Booking.com. 

On arrival you and your wife were very argumentative with each other. 

On entry to your Apartment you requested a  twin room as you did not wish to sleep together for your personal reasons at the time. 

You then forcefully and rudely demanded that you have a twin room and stated that you had booked a twin room. 

You had not booked an Apartment with a twin bed and at the late stage of your arrival we could not offer an alternative as we were fully booked. 

We provided you with your booking confirmation details which clearly detailed your Apartment, its location within the building complex. 

Pictures and check-in details were also sent to you all without any response. 

You continued to intimidate our staff saying that you had booked an Apartment with a twin bed. 

Your Apartment had two Bedrooms, sofa bed and also a Guest bed but you didn’t want to use any of those facilities either. 

Well in advance of your arrival (two months prior) we contacted you to ask if you may have any special requirements/requests for your Apartment and unfortunately you did not reply. 

You were both very rude to our Manager who tried everything to help you. 

Booking.com were contacted in your presence  and they confirmed that you did not book an apartment with a twin room facility. 

They offered to relocate you, as we had a wait list we were happy to allow that without charges to you.  

You then decided to stay. 

We then personally checked you in. You didn’t want to go through the full check-in process. 

We offered to help you with local guides and recommendations and you refused that offer. 

You were smoking/vaping in the Apartment and had be politely reminded not to smoke/vape in the Apartment which you continued to do. 

You also left a mess in the Apartment on departure, dismantled furniture and caused damage. 

We had other Guests contact us out of concern as you were causing a disturbance outside the building late at night, including  banging your vehicle doors very late at night/in small hours. 

You were away by the time we came round to speak to you about the situation.

This was the first time we have experienced such bizarre behaviour and on your departure just put it down to a one off isolated event. 

The Apartment was perfect and spotless clean.

It is clear that your comments and review are disingenuous and so far removed from reality.

We have an onsite laundry facility and if you had let us know that there were marks on linen we would have changed them for you straight away, please be assured however that all linens are completely 100% sanitised, are put through clinical standard safe wash processes as well as meeting sustainable and eco-friendly credentials. The linens never have any stains but you may be referring to occasional machine-caused discolouration, your comments on this are an anomaly as we quality check all linens before building up our unique bedding arrangement. In regards to the ventilation, there is a switch clearly marked outside the bathroom where the bathroom extractor fan can be completely deactivated or speed reduced to a silent low trickle, if you had let us know we would have happily helped you identify that switch or come round and adjusted it for you.

Your feedback is vital to help other travellers make their reservation choices and we take this opportunity to assure all travellers that our TV entertainment solution has been exceptionally well received by a wide audience. 

The platform had been designed in conjunction with our software developers and Apple, providing a unique international hospitality TV solution. 

The solution allows Guests to contact us 24hrs a day via the TV for any support or supplies required during their stay. 

For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of travellers who may be considering your comments when making their booking choice, our TV solution does not require guests to login. 

There are a good selection of free view options which do not require any logins. The login is optional. 

The TV platform also provides local information and recommendations, both national and international travellers have really appreciated this feature, it is a wealth of information available at your fingertips and content is regularly updated.  

Our solution ensures a secure home from home entertainment solution can be experienced while travelling, at the same time personal data is protected, during use, and between guest use. 

Our TV’s are configured to allow screen sharing/mirroring so you may securely cast to the TV from your own device. This adds even greater options, privacy and security. Business travellers have used this facility to conduct online meetings and have used the TV’s for presentations. 

We have moved away from the archaic pay per view systems where Hotels historically have charged guests for very basic and limited in-room entertainment.

This has added immense value to our offering and guests have loved it and families have made full use of the free to use system. 

This is all delivered via our own hyper optic fibre network (the only one of its kind in the Highlands) and combined with the specially designed Samsung 4k Hospitality TV’s offers an unrivalled in-room entertainment experience for all guests.

The meticulous attention to detail throughout the project has been second to none including the development of the bespoke in-room entertainment system. 

We have brought the very first classified Apartment Hotel to the Highlands in a unique location, sympathetically and painstakingly converting a truly outstanding historic building. 

We have sympathetically combined the Victorian building with full modern facilities in a safe, secure and environmentally friendly way for Guests to experience. 

Our personal service is made possible via an exceptional team which includes gardeners, maintenance, cleaners, housekeeping, laundry services, guest experience managers, tour operation, corporate client management, parking management, security services, technical support, property management and so much more.

Therefore, we were not expecting you and as the reservation was cancelled, we could not issue you with the self-check in information or plan for the receptionist to meet you either. Only registered Patrons can access our property and you did not enter inside our property at any time, and you did not stay in any of our Apartments.

2022-08-07 22:06:47,Claire,3298402906,Terrible experience,"The accommodation is nice and well presented , had the experience been much better I would have rated them highb","after arriving at 8pm Friday to have a few drinks and play some henny games , some of us went to bed at 10.40 the latest was 12.20am, for a group of 22 people I think at was pretty good . The owner was well aware we was a hen party

Sent us a message at 8 pm last night when we had been out the apartment all day from 12.45pm telling us we wasn't getting back in and was always Aware we was a hen party . It was a large group booking and there is always going to be some kind of noise with such a large party , I did let you know we was staying in the apartment Friday night ( we was playing games for the hen party ) but the latest people went to bed was 12.20. If you check back cctv some starting going to bed around 10.45 . The room was set up to sleep 8 people , even 8 people in one room will generate some noise . When I spoke with you on the phone when we first booked you told me you would make other guests aware that there a hen party staying and to expect some noise . We didn't arrive until nearly 8pm Friday night and then we went to bed just after 12am , we was not disrespectful to any guests staying. We took care of the apartments , cleaned all our rubbish out , took them out to waste , people
Was smoking at the side and you do have a cigarette butt bin there , all butts was put in there and we also saw other guests smoking there so was not just us . There was one almost empty bear left on the reception desk as we headed out for taxi on Saturday this was a general mistake , just rushing to get out to the taxi on time . There wasn't alcohol left everywhere . 
Then to be told there wasn't late check out arranged when there was and to wait in the seating areas for our bus it was so unprofessional",4,5,10,7.5,7.5,2.5,7.5,"Dear Claire, we agree, it was a terrible experience for us. 

You arrived late and your group was heavily intoxicated and behaved in a drunk and disorderly fashion. As the group leader, you took no responsibility for your group or the groups behaviour. 

Our staff tried to help as much as possible but your group was out of control, some falling down the stairs as they could not stay standing due to the level of intoxication, others were smoking in the doorway, others were abusive and rude to staff, you were neglectful and  disrespectful and you breached our quiet hours policy. 

You did not respond when we contacted you, we made attempts to warn you of the actions we would take for the policy breach, but you did not respond. 

Therefore, within a few hours of your arrival you were asked to leave the premises. Your group then decided to disperse back to their designated apartments and eventually everything settled by 1am. 

Your conduct was reported to Booking.com who advised that we modify your reservation to a one night stay and not allow you back into the building for another night. They recorded your behaviour as guest misconduct. 

You protested and said your group would be left stranded without accommodation if you were not allowed to stay the second night. As you were in breach of our terms of stay we were not obligated to relocate you and due to guest misconduct the booking agent was also not responsible to relocate you. 

We decided to assist you and your group by allowing the second night stay, this was on condition and agreement that there would not be any further disturbance from your group, your group would observe our quiet hour rules and on return from your outing go straight to bed and check out speedily in the morning without causing any inconvenience to other guests, staff or management. 

You had originally extended your check-out however due to your conduct and behaviour you were reverted to a standard check-out. 
 
On check-out, you were still in your apartments at 12pm, we never rushed you and assisted you by allowing you the time to get yourselves organised and allocated you a designated wait area within our property for your bus to arrive.

We care deeply for our property, all our guests, our neighbourhood and environment and have a great responsibility to ensure no one causes any upset, damage or nuisance.

You had a perfect opportunity to enjoy our fabulous property and setting for your occasion however you crossed the line of decency and respectability. 

You should not be looking to blame others, it was your responsibility to control the conduct and behaviour of your group and to stay cooperative. Your groups behaviour was disappointing and was not welcome at Rosedene. 

You let yourself and your group down by being disruptive and ignorant of our house rules, you spoilt your own experience and we are not sure that you will even remember much of it due to your state of intoxication.

We have had many groups stay and enjoy Rosedene for occasions and celebrations such as stag do’s, hen do’s, weddings, birthdays, honeymoons. anniversary’s etc. Everyone has been completely respectful and observant of house rules and policies of stay and they all fully enjoyed their occasions. 

We wish you all the best and would still like to receive you again at Rosedene however in different circumstances, we believe you and your group individually are good people but on this group occasion you let yourselves down. 

We are satisfied that we controlled the situation and handled it well to your own benefit and to the benefit of others. 

Best Regards, from all at Rosedene Highland House

It was great to see you and family and we are really glad you enjoyed the stay and area. We would like to apologise for any items in the kitchen that may have been missing or not included as you may have expected. Your reservation was made late in the evening for an immediate arrival. Housekeeping staff were off at that time and we did try our best to check all inventory before you arrived, however there was very little time and we focussed on ensuring your bedding was all set up ready for your arrival and asked that you let us know in the morning if we may have missed anything, also during your stay we followed up to ask if everything was as you expect and you confirmed it was. We note the feedback of being a little expensive but would like to note that we offer what we believe is an unparalleled service along with great facility and the most enviable location. In comparison to the leas expensive accommodation you had originally booked elsewhere, we understand the accommodation you had originally booked elsewhere in Inverness had left you stranded, they were not contactable and you couldn’t access their property. We went out of our way to accommodate you and help you at that time and we always endeavour to ensure complete satisfaction every time. We take on board your valuable feedback and will try harder and look at where we may be able to add any additional kitchen items, although the kitchen was and is fully equipped for 6 guests. Thanks so much again and we are looking forward to welcoming you again and next time hopefully it won’t be in such a last minute situation. Take care from all at Rosedene Highland House.  "

The TV is huge and has every single app. The host is lovely and tries (and manages) to meet every single need of yours. He takes care of everything and is really friendly. Even after our check-out from the flat, he helped us with couple things that we needed to get around the city. Totally recommend Rosedene and the location is also fantastic and is close to some other attractions like the Ness Islands.

There is nothing cheap about the supplies, we think you are referring to a wine opener which you either broke or found broken by a previous guest. However you were immediately provided with a new one without question. We also checked prior to your arrival if the apartment you booked was suitable for your group, from the reservation request we see that you were on a very tight budget. We are a quality and service led establishment dealing with short stay and long stay guests both leisure and corporate, we could not reduce the rate for you. On arrival you didn’t wish to engage or speak with the manager who offered to help you and provide a personal check-in. You just carried on into your apartment. The manager would have helped you to understand your apartment layout and how to maximise your space as a group, he would have put your cases up onto the luggage store in your apartment giving you even more space, the manager even messaged you after you checked-in to let you know how to maximise space easily and reached out to help you, you never responded. Your studio apartment wasn’t small so that is a confusing remark, the bathroom alone is very large, with a large walk in shower, and the apartment and building is loaded with value and facility which you maybe just didn’t get a chance to appreciate during your short stay and especially as you arrived late. were out early and returned late. At the time of your stay we were completely booked out and had a wait list, in such a high demand situation and being at peak season our rate was exceptionally competitive for such an amazing apartment in an amazing building, with great facilities in an outstanding location. Next time if you are returning please do try and answer our pre check in messages, communicate with management and answer post check in messages so we can help and enhance your experience. Take care from all at Rosedene Highland House. "

2023-07-01 21:01:24,Elan,2877444790,Beautiful apartment just a walk away from everything else! The host was impolite at the end.,"1. Loved how strategically located it is. Calm neighborhood and just a 20 minute walk from city center. Having the river walk just across the street was an absolute treat! 
2. Great facilities. Fridge, heater, microwave, kettle, tea and coffee, hairdryer, iron, and much more was provided that we didn’t even need to use. 
3. Mr.Amjad was friendly and quite helpful! He gave us a list of recommended things to do and see in Inverness. It was convenient that he was just a WhatsApp message away if we needed anything.","1. We asked for early check in between 12:00-13:00, and arrived an hour earlier than we had told them due to our trip not having delays. Unfortunately it seemed like they didn’t have a lobby or any area for us to sit. We were asked to leave our luggage and come back later which was quite inconvenient especially just spending 15 hours at the airport and being totally exhausted. They should have a seating area for this sort of thing instead of sending their guests out in the cold to come back at check in time. We met an Australian couple a few days into our stay who also seemed to have the same issue as they were waiting for the host to come and let them in. I’ve attached photos of the early check in confirmation and the host telling us to come back since he is so insistant on calling me a liar.
2. I initially rated the host as very friendly but after leaving an excellent review of a 9/10 on booking, he sent me a message on WhatsApp and called me a liar and denied leaving us outside. He was very rude in his response. The stay was excellent but the host cannot take feedback and left a poor taste in my mouth after this bad final interaction. I wonder how many other  people were contacted and called liars after leaving a review of less than 10/10 with factual constructive criticism. 
3. The emperor bed that was provided was not an intrinsically large bed but rather 2 beds stuck together. It wasn’t comfortable having a crack running through my back all night so I had to use it like a smaller bed by sleeping on the sides to be more comfortable which defeats the whole purpose of a larger bed.",7,5,7.5,10,10,10,10,"Dear Ella, it is wonderful to have such great positive feedback. However not all your feedback is an accurate account of the your particular circumstances. During your stay you had also upset other guests unnecessarily. Our Check-in time is 4pm.

For the avoidance of doubt for anyone reading Ella’s comments, the following was our communications with Ella following her initial review which she has since changed.

However being factual in reviews is important, your negative comments don’t appear factual and we are sorry that you felt you had to make such comments. You are aware our Check-in time is 4pm.

Your arrival day happened to be one of the warmest days we have had recently. Your luggage was taken in and safely placed into your apartment immediatley. Other guests were not impressed with your interaction with them. Your negative comments are isolated and not reflective of our property or apartments and doesn’t take into consideration your specific reservation arrangements.

We are an award winning and globally accredited business evidenced by our display of the ISAAP Accreditation marque. 

Demand is very high and as such not everyone can get an opportunity to stay and experience Rosedene.

Unfortunately you spoilt your own stay experience by overcrowding (unauthorised numbers). Your communications were very poor, and we were not notified of any preferences or additional occupiers prior to your arrival, this was a breach of our stay policy. 

We reached out to you at the time you made your reservation but received no response.

We reached out to you again prior to arrival and also sent you photo’s including the apartment exterior and its location within the complex, you made no comments.

The Manager offered to meet you, but you did not respond.

We have checked the photographs on your reservation confirmation, they are 100% accurate to the Apartment you booked.

The apartment was spotless clean on your arrival.

The apartment is in very high demand, and you reserved it during one of the busiest periods. The apartment is much loved and one of the most booked in the complex. It's a 1920’s annex connected to the original Victorian building and not a new extension. It once was the nurses training centre when Rosedene was a care establishment and maternity hospital.

Nobody disturbed you other than a lovely family (couple with two young children) who arrived late for check-in and came by your door by mistake.  

The heat settings are noted in the apartment and there are in-room controls, we can also set the temperature for you to your preference, but you did not make any request.

You did boost your night temperature to 24 degrees in the warm weather which would have been very uncomfortable for most people.

You took advantage of our good nature but we still assisted you and helped you as our guests. "

Parkeren voor de deur. Je kon naar de stad lopen via de Ness-eilandjes in de rivier de Ness via Victoriaanse loopbruggetjes. Er lag veel toeristische informatie in de hal en op de kamer.
